## Description
Stream Snipers is a Web App which will allow a user to find which of their favorite shows and movies are on which streaming service.
At Stream Snipers you can create your own account, search for shows/movies, view pricing options, select your favorites, and view similar shows/movies. This will allow you to better decide which streaming services have the shows/movies you want and save you money.

## User Story
Given I am a poor soul looking to watch my favorite shows and movies at a reasonable price,   
I want an app that allows me to see which shows and movies are on which streaming services and allows me to compare prices. 
- As a user, I should be able to Sign up for an account
- As a user, I should be able to login with a previously made account.
- As a logged in user, there should be a big search bar to find a movie.
- When a movie is found, a link should take you directly to the movie on the correct platform.
- As a logged in user, I should be able to post a review about a movie/show I searched for.
- As a logged in user, I should be able to see reviews left by other users on a particular movie.
- As a user, I should be able to review my search history.
- As a Manager, I should be able to delete reviews.
- As a user, I should be able to request for a movie recommendation based on an input.
- A user should be able to favorite a movie/show so that they can come back and find it later easily.
